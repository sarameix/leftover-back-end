**Live Recipes API Site: https://leftover-backend.azurewebsites.net/api/recipes**

This repository contains an API website created for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. This API was created using C# and a .NET framework, and both the API and the PSQL database are being hosted using Microsoft Azure. It contains information for both ingredient and recipe models in order to support a frontend application that allows users to keep track of what's in their pantry and what recipes they can make with those food items. Ingredient models contain information on the name, age, and quantity of an ingredient in the user's pantry. Recipe models contain information on the name, total time, matched ingredients, remaining ingredients, and link for each saved recipe. Both models have full CRUD functionality working.
